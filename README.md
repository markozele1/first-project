# first-project
making an html-based recipes site including a couple of recipes

First collect some protein-packed recipes and add them to a file called 'recipes.txt', and their images to folder 'recipe-images'

Then build main html page index.html with links to the recipes, including images - maybe even sort them by salty or sweet

After the main page, make a sample page for a recipe and copy paste it for each recipe, including prep description, image, link to recipe preparation if necessary, and all needed for a viewer to see

At the end brush out some visual related stuff on pages
